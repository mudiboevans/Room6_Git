# Room6_Git

We have been asked to create a reprository for collaborative purposes.

One of us should be a leader. Then he/she will invite others as collaborators

The collaborators should folk the repo into their remote accounts and clone to make it accessible on the local machine
 
**1. Let's make a small bios or brief discription of ourselves**<br>
**2. We could as well talk about our career plans**
